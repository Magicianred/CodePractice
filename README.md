# Code Practice

Sample codes, tests, best practices, tests and more...

It will be an open repository, experimental, use it with care.

## Share code

This code is not meant to be the best, some are just attempts.

*Warning! It is not ready for production* !!!  :D

If it's useful, use it.  
If you have any advice for me, thanks!

__Enjoy your code!!!__ :)

### Unit Test

I love to test! I want to do more!  
I will try to do some example to basic project ready for test.

#### Practice in real code

Nothing better than trying, I cloned some repository to code and try to add test in these projects.
